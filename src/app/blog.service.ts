      <span><p dir="ltr"><span>Afriwave Telecom Ghana Limited as part of its sustainable Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiative has rehabilitated an existing water facility at Ekye Amanfrom in the Kwahu Afram Plains South District in the Eastern Region of Ghana.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>The water facility which was constructed by Millennium International Development Agency (MiDA) has been abandoned by the community for a decade due to the salty taste of the water which was sourced from borehole water.

Raw water is channelled through treatment plants before it is pumped into water storage tanks to be accessed by the people. The facility which cost GHC42, 800 is expected to provide safe drinking water to over 7000 residents, who were relying on the raw water from the Afram River for their water needs. Speaking at the inauguration ceremony, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Afriwave Telecom, Mr. Francis Poku said access to safe drinking water was a fundamental right of every citizen.

Mr. Searyoh further said providing water to the people of Ekye Amanfrom is a key ingredient to the fight against COVID-19 which the president of Ghana is doing its best to stop the spread. He added that the company was not only interested in conducting its core business of Interconnecting and providing innovative mobile service solutions to all networks but investing in the communities in which it operates. 'Afriwave is a people-centered brand and we are happy to touch a life by saving the residents of Ekye Amanfrom from drinking unclean water,' he stated.
